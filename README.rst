==================================
Genimage - The Image Creation Tool
==================================

genimage is a tool to generate multiple filesystem and flash/disk images
from a given root filesystem tree. genimage is intended to be run
in a fakeroot environment.
It also supports creating flash/disk images out of different file-system images and files.

Configuration is done in a config file parsed by libconfuse. Options
like the path to tools can be given via environment variables, the config
file or from commandline switches.

The Configuration File
======================

The config file of genimage uses a simple configuration language, provided by libconfuse.
This supports nested sections, as well as simple key-value pairs.

The config file is separated into the main sections ``image``, ``flash`` and ``config``,
and provides an ``include`` primitive.

The image section
-----------------

An image section describes a single filesystem or disk image to be built. It can be given
multiple times to generate multiple images. An image can also have multiple
partitions which refer to images themselves.
Each image must have a type which can have different suboptions depending on
the type.

Let's have a look at an example::

  image nand-pcm038.img {
	  flash {
	  }
	  flashtype = "nand-64M-512"
	  partition barebox {
		  image = "barebox-pcm038.bin"
		  size = 512K
	  }
	  partition root {
		  image = "root-nand.jffs2"
		  size = 24M
	  }
  }

This would generate a nand-pcm038.img which is a flash of type "nand-64M-512"
The image contains two partitions, "barebox-pcm038.bin" and "root-nand.jffs2"
which must refer to images described elsewhere in the config file. For example
"root-nand.jffs2" partition could be described like this::

  image root-nand.jffs2 {
	  name = "root"
	  jffs2 {}
	  size = 24M
	  mountpoint = "/"
  }

In this case a single jffs2 image is generated from the root mountpoint.

Here are all options for images:

:name:		The name of this image. This is used for some image types
		to set the name of the image.
:size:		Size of this image in bytes
:mountpoint:	mountpoint if image refers to a filesystem image.
:exec-pre:	Custom command to run before generating the image.
:exec-post:	Custom command to run after generating the image.
:flashtype:	refers to a flash section. Optional for non flash like images
		like hd images
:partition:	can be given multiple times and refers to a partition described
		below

additionally each image can have one of the following sections describing the
type of the image:

cpio, cramfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, file, flash, hdimage, iso, jffs2, qemu, squashfs,
tar, ubi, ubifs, vfat.

partition options:

:offset:		The offset of this partition as a total offset to the beginning
			of the device.
:size:			The size of this partition in bytes. The last partition may have
			size 0 to make this partition use the rest of the available space
			on the device.
:partition-type:	Used by dos partition tables to specify the partition type.
:image:			The image file this partition shall be filled with
:autoresize:		used by ubi (FIXME: do we need this? isn't size = 0 enough)	
:bootable:		Boolean specifying whether to set the bootable flag.
:in-partition-table:	Boolean specifying whether to include this partition in
			the partition table.

			filesystem image from input file "bar"
:files:			A list of filenames added into the filesystem image. Like :file:
			above, but without the ability to add the files under different
			name.

The Flash Section
-----------------

The flash section can be given multiple times and each section describes a
flash chip. The option names are mostly derived from the UBI terminology.
There are the following options:

:pebsize:		The size of a physical eraseblock in bytes
:lebsize:		The size of a logical eraseblock in bytes (for ubifs)
:numpebs:		Number of physical eraseblocks on this device. The total
			size of the device is determined by pebsize * numpebs
:minimum-io-unit-size:	The minimum size in bytes accessible on this device
:vid-header-offset:	offset of the volume identifier header
:sub-page-size:		The size of a sub page in bytes.

Several flash related image types need a valid flash section. From the image types
the flash type section is referred to using the ``flashtype`` option which contains
the name of the flash type to be used.

For more information of the meaning of these values see the ubi(fs) and mtd faqs:

http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/faq/general.html

example flash section::

  flash nand-64M-512 {
	  pebsize = 16384
	  lebsize = 15360
	  numpebs = 4096
	  minimum-io-unit-size = 512
	  vid-header-offset = 512
	  sub-page-size = 512
  }
  ...
  image jffs2 {
	  flashtype = "nand-64M-512"
  }


The config section
------------------

In this section the global behaviour of the program is described. All options
here can be given from either environment variables, the config file or
command line switches. For instance, a config option ``foo`` can be passed as a
``--foo`` command line switch or as a GENIMAGE_FOO environment variable.

:config:	default: ``genimage.cfg``
		Path to the genimage config file.

:loglevel:	default: 1
		genimage log level.

:outputpath:	default: images
		Mandatory path where all images are written to (must exist).
:inputpath:	default: input
		This mandatory path is searched for input images, for example
		bootloader binaries, kernel images (must exist).
:rootpath:	default: root
		Mandatory path to the root filesystem (must exist).
:tmppath:	default: tmp
		Optional path to a temporary directory. There must be enough space
		available here to hold a copy of the root filesystem.

Include Configurations Fragments
--------------------------------

To include a ``"foo.cfg"`` config file, use the following statement::

    include("foo.cfg")
    
This allows to re-use, for example flash configuration files, accross different image configurations.
